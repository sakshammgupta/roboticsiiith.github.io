abstract: "Underwater gliders are common robotic platforms that usually have at least three degrees of freedom (DoF), namely surge, heave, and pitch. The eave motion generated using variable buoyancy can be vectored along surge direction using wings. These gliders are usually designed to be operated for specific applications and the mission dictates the diving requirements, usually quantified using factors such as dive-cycle, dive-in-depth, and range. Several parameters influence diving performance, of which, dimension and position of the wing play a significant role. The objective of this work is to study the effect of wing parameters such as the position of the wing (along the hull) and its dimensions, on the diving performance of the glider and thereby determine their optimal values for a given mission requirement. The wing can be accordingly designed and attached to the hull of the glider. The design and dynamics of RoBuoy, a novel underwater glider, is used for this study. Conveniently RoBuoy’s design allows modular wing positioning and dimensions, and hence the results of the study can be tested on this platform. A detailed study of the influence of the chosen wing parameters on the dynamics of the glider along with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach to optimizing the parameters is presented in this paper."
